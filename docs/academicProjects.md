???+ abstract "<span style="color:purple">Digit classifier on the SVHN (Street View Housing Number) dataset</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[:simple-github:](https://github.com/dash-abhinandita/Digit_classifier){target="_blank"}"
      ![alt text](images/street.jpeg){: style="width:200px; "; align=left } <br> 
      The SVHN is a real-world image dataset comprising over **600,000** digit images for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms. The variability in the visual appearance of text is due to range of fonts, colours, styles, orientations, and character arrangements. The recognition problem is complicated by environmental factors such as lighting, shadows, specularity, and occlusions as well as by image acquisition factors such as resolution, motion, and focus blurs. In this project, the objective is to build a digit classifier which can predict the multi-digit numbers in the photographs captured at street level from a subset of data over **100,000**.<br><br>
